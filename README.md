### Diffify

Diffify enables quick and easy comparison between different versions of any R package stored on CRAN. In particular, Diffify provides information from the News file, as well as changes in the dependencies, namespace and functions of a package.

Explore the tool at [diffify.com](https://diffify.com/).
